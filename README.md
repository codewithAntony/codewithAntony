# Hey! I'm Antony 👋

### Software Engineer | Building solutions, One Cup of Tea at a Time.

I'm a software engineer based in the heart of the "Silicon Savannah."

When I'm not debugging code or wrestling with merge conflicts,

I'm likely looking for the best Nyama Choma in town

or explaining to my relatives that "no, I cannot fix your printer"


My main tech stack is react, typescript and golang.


### ⚡ Fun Facts
- ☕ **Fuel:** Powered by Kericho Gold and 2 AM motivation.
- 🦁 **Location:** Living in the only city in the world with a National Park.
- 💻 **Setup:** Dark mode everything. If it's light mode, it's a bug.
- 🛣️ **Commute:** I've solved more bugs in Nairobi traffic than in my office.
