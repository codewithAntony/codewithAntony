Hey! 

I'm [Antony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-murithi-namu/) a data and ML literate software engineer based in Kenya.


When I'm not debugging code or wrestling with merge conflicts,

I'm likely looking for the best Nyama Choma in town

or explaining to my relatives that "no, I cannot fix your printer"


I'm productive in Python, go, and JS/TS.
